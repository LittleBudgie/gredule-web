    <h1> Gredule Privacy Policy </h1>
    <br> <br> <br>
    <h2> Data Involved </h2>
    <br>
    <p> There are two main types of data involved. </p>
    <ul> <li> Times tasks are done </li>
    <li> Description of task being done </li> </ul>
    <p> All data entered into the Gredule website–tasks and times entered to create the green schedule–are stored locally through local storage and sent to the Chrome Extension to be viewed as a popup. Once the user opens the Gredule website tab, any information that the user enters into this tab in the form of times or task descriptions are sent from the website to the Chrome Extension popup for display. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <p> No other data is collected from the user besides what they input into the Gredule website. This data is not sent to any other third-parties, but instead uses local storage to save to the user’s device.
    </p> 
    <br> <br>
    <h2> Reason for Collecting Data Mentioned Above </h2>
    <br>
    <p> The data above is collected for the purpose of the extension and website–to get information about the user’s schedule and suggest ways to make it more environmentally friendly. Thus, any information entered in the form of times and descriptions of tasks being done entered into the website are analyzed to make these suggestions. This data is simply saved on the user’s device by utilizing local storage.
    </p>
    <br> <br>
    <h2> How Website Collects Data </h2>
    <br>
    <p> Gredule collects data when the user enters their schedule into the Gredule website. The schedule entered is stored in the form of local storage.
    </p>
    <br> <br>
    <h2> What Data Will Be Used For </h2>
    <br>
    <p> The data will not be used or sent to any external third parties. This data is also not collected by the Gredule website other than in the form of local storage on the user’s device to ensure they have their schedule every time they open the extension and/or popup in the Chrome Extension.
    </p>
    <br> <br> 
    <h2> Statement on Protection </h2>
    <br> 
    <p> None of the data entered will be sent to external third parties. All data, if ever collected, will simply be for storage purposes on the user’s device. 
    </p>
    <br> <br>
    <h2> Changes to Privacy Policy and Contact Questions</h2>
    <br>
    <p> Any changes to privacy policy will be displayed through a banner on the popup of the Chrome Extension as well as a banner on the website detailing privacy policy changes. The privacy policy will always be open to reference on the Gredule website. For questions, please contact mygredule@gmail.com.
